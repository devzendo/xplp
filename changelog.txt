# CrossPlatformLauncherPlugin Change history

v0.1.0 01/08/2010 first release 
  * Mostly tested on Mac OS X, but should work on Windows and Linux.

v0.2.0 28/09/2010 second release
  * Adds support for generating launchers containing JNI code using the
    maven-nar-plugin.

v0.2.1 19/04/2011 third release
  * Fixes a Linux launching bug where the error code was not being returned
    correctly
  * Changed the Windows-specific janelType configuration property to be
    available in all builds, and renamed it launcherType. It only makes sense
    on Windows or MacOSX. Use of janelType now fails the build with a message
    saying "use launcherType". On MacOSX, use the console launcherType to
    create a structure like that used on Linux; GUI is still the default and
    still creates a .app structure.
  
v0.2.2 25/09/2013 fourth release
  * First release to the Central Maven Repository; updated parent to that on
    Central; no functional changes.
