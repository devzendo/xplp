# CrossPlatformLauncherPlugin Change history

v0.1.0 01/08/2010 first release
  * Mostly tested on Mac OS X, but should work on Windows and Linux.

v0.2.0 28/09/2010 second release
  * Adds support for generating launchers containing JNI code using the
    maven-nar-plugin.

v0.2.1 19/04/2011 third release
  * Fixes a Linux launching bug where the error code was not being returned
    correctly
  * Changed the Windows-specific janelType configuration property to be
    available in all builds, and renamed it launcherType. It only makes sense
    on Windows or MacOSX. Use of janelType now fails the build with a message
    saying "use launcherType". On MacOSX, use the console launcherType to
    create a structure like that used on Linux; GUI is still the default and
    still creates a .app structure.
  
v0.2.2 25/09/2013 fourth release
  * First release to the Central Maven Repository; updated parent to that on
    Central; no functional changes.

v1.1.0 21/09/2017 fifth release

  * Source moved to bitbucket, updated many dependencies.
  * Fix bug: expand the shell's arguments in double quotes, so that if you use quotes to preserve a single argument
    containing spaces, the Java program receives it as a single argument.
  * Built with Java 1.7.
  * Added the universal application stub v2.1.0 from Tobias Fischer. This allows OSX launchers to run with JVMs
    more modern than Apple's Java 1.6. The default stub is still Apple's: to switch to the universal stub and run
    with the most modern JVM you have, use the <stubType>Universal</stubType> option in your configuration.

v1.1.1 28/09/2017 sixth release

  * Corrected typos in documentation.

v1.2.0 21/02/2019 seventh release

  * Windows: Added the enhanced version of Janel 4.2.0-98 from Michael Knigge https://github.com/michaelknigge/janel
    To provide support for 64-bit modern Java, Java 9, etc. - see the Github page for details.
    The default version of Janel is still 3.0.2 for backwards compatibility. To switch to the enhanced Janel
    use the <janelVersion>4.2</janelVersion> and optionally <janelBits>64</janelBits> (default) or
    <janelBits>32</janelBits> to switch between 64- and 32-bit variants.
